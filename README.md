Project Ruby is an in-car entertainment system designed to integrate with Google Maps, Spotify and an in car OBD2 reader to report back in car telemetry

This is developed for use with a Microsoft Surface Pro 3, however this should work with any x86_64 compatible tablet (preferably a 2-in-1 style tablet, like a Surface).
